Answers to the Editor Project

1. How many branches does each project have?

	Emacs has 83 branches. 

	Nano has 6 branches.
	
	Vim has 2 branches. 

2. What programming language was each program primarily developed in?

	All three of the editors, Emacs, Nano and Vim were all 	primarily written in the C programming language. 

3. Describe the commit history for each in term of commit messages. In other words, what do you find interesting about the evolution of the project, messages, or whatever else. 

	For emacs, some of the commit messages ae pretty long compared to others. There doesn't seem to be a set way for how they are using the commit messages. There are a lot of people who are making commits to this project. A lot of merging is going on in this project as well. Also most of the stuff in the history log I could not make sense of. 

	For nano, the commit messages are able to be understood by anyone. They donâ€™t use any type of code to convey what was done in the commit. Very short and simple commits for this repo. They way that the commits were done here are what I think commits should look like. Very different from emacs.
